/// <summary>
/// This sample introduces concurrent execution using "fan-out" and "fan-in" patterns.
///
/// Unlike sequential workflows where executors run one after another, this workflow
/// runs multiple executors in parallel to process the same input simultaneously.
///
/// The workflow structure:
/// 1. StartExecutor sends the same question to two AI agents concurrently (fan-out)
/// 2. Physicist Agent and Chemist Agent answer independently and in parallel
/// 3. AggregationExecutor collects both responses and combines them (fan-in)
///
/// This pattern is useful when you want multiple perspectives on the same input,
/// or when you can break work into independent parallel tasks for better performance.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Pre-requisites:
/// - Foundational samples should be completed first.
/// - An Azure OpenAI chat completion deployment must be configured.
/// </remarks>
