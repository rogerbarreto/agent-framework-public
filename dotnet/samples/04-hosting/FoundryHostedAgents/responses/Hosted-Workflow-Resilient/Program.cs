// Resilient Translation Chain Workflow Agent — the same sequential translation workflow as
// Hosted-Workflow-Simple, hosted as a durable long-running (resilient) Foundry Hosted Agent.
//
// What "resilient" adds here:
//   - The workflow is hosted with ResilientBackground = true. For a background response
//     (store=true, background=true), the platform keeps the agent running with no client
//     connected and re-invokes the handler after a container crash or graceful shutdown.
//   - A workflow hosted as an agent checkpoints its progress between executor steps and resumes
//     from its last checkpoint. The hosting handler persists the session at each completed output
//     item, so a crash mid-run loses at most the step that was in flight.
//   - Everything is opt-in: without ResilientBackground the agent behaves exactly like the
//     non-resilient sample.
//
// See the README for the local crash-and-recover walkthrough.

// Create translation agents. Each becomes a workflow step, so each completed translation is a
// natural checkpoint boundary the platform can resume from.
//
// IMPORTANT for resilient workflows: give every agent a STABLE Id. A workflow checkpoint records
// each step by its executor id, and an agent-backed step derives that id from the agent's Id (and
// Name). By default an agent gets a fresh random Id per process, so after a crash the restarted
// process would rebuild the workflow with different ids and the saved checkpoint would no longer
// match, failing the resume. Fixed ids keep the rebuilt workflow identical across restarts.
